        <h2>Come to think of it, neither is the one on the right.</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>On top, our national C-production racing champion. For two years now, it has beaten some of the fastest competition in the country.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Beneath it, a "stock" 240-Z. Only with the Datsun, "stock" covers a lot of ground. Performance goodies like a 2.4 liter overhead cam engine, radial tires, safety front disc brakes and fully independent suspension. Luxury touches like AM/FM radio, reclinable bucket seats, electric antenna and wall-to-wall nylon carpeting. They're all standard equipment on the 240-Z. It's a champion GT with all the comforts of a luxury sedan. Maybe that's not everything...but it sure beats whatever's second.</p>
